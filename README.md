# 📃 Bookinng car api

in this project, I built a RESTFUL api using Rails and Json Web Token for authenticating users, the data will be fetched by the front end app and display them to the user.

## 📡 technologies used

- Ruby
- Rails
- Faker
- Rubocop
- Webpacker
- Postgresql
- Json Web Token
- Git

## 🚀 the project

This project can be found in (https://github.com/RoodzFernando/booking-car-api/)

## 🔨 instructions

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Next seed the database

```
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
